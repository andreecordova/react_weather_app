# Weather app

A simple project to check the weather searching for cities and using the openweather api

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

For this project you must have nodeJS in your OS

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/es/)
    - [For Windows, MacOS or linux (Source code)](https://nodejs.org/es/download/)
    - [For linux distributions](https://nodejs.org/es/download/package-manager/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#debian-stable)

You can verify if you have node using this commands in your terminal:

```
node -v
```

Other thing you need is an api key from [openweather.org](https://openweathermap.org/). You only must to login in in the website to get your own api key.

### Installing

After you complete all the prerequisites of the project, you must located inside the project folder and execute this command in your terminal:

```
npm install
```

or

```
yarn
```

These commands generated all the modules, plugins, dependencies that we need to have our workstation ready

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run different types of scripts with the help of create-react-app, like:

### `start`

```
npm run start
```
or

```
yarn start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `test`

```
npm run test
```
or

```
yarn test
```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `build`

```
npm run build
```
or

```
yarn build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

```
npm run eject
```
or

```
yarn eject
```

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
